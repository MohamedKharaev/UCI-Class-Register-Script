UCI CLASS BOT

This is just a list of things users need to know

1) Make sure to leave all 3 files in this folder and to run the bot from within it.

2) After submitting the form, keep your laptop open AND DON'T LET IT SLEEP THIS IS VERY
   IMPORTANT. Turn off your laptop's sleep timer if you want to leave it on overnight. 

3) This bot will only run if you have Google Chrome installed.

4) The registration date field must follow the format in the example (MMM DD YYYY HH:MM).

5) For every class in the main section that doesn't get added, a class in the alternate
   classes section will get added. The bot will cycle through them until enough are 
   added so have alternates.

6) If you want a certain class but are worried about the discussion being filled up, 
   add the same class along with a different discussion to the alternative classes section.

7) Double check your password is correct. If you get it wrong, theres nothing the bot can
   do about it.
